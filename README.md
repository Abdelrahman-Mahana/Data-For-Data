# 30-Day-of-Data-

## this is my learning journey to learn and understand more and more about Data
##### In this repo, I will write my daily habits of learning " problem solving, structure & algorithms, data science tools, computer vision, NLP , Machine learning & Deep learning "





**Day 1 of 30 Day of Data**
- Today I was excited to learn Object Detection using TensorFlow Object detection API, so I started studying it, This video was interesting to start with, it explains how to make [Real-Time Sign Language Detection with Tensorflow Object Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDXdlXlaCco) and Python | Deep Learning SSD ,so this is a good start for me to get an idea of TensorFlow Object detection API, after this video, I started installing TensorFlow Object detection API on my local computer, but I faced many bugs in the begging so if you try to install it take a deep breath and watch this video about how to [Install Tensorflow Object Detection From Scratch in 5 Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZh_ps8gKgs), and this is everything for today see you the next day 


**Day 2 of 30 Day of Data**
- today I started my step by step object detection project from scratch using TensorFlow object detection API and python, I create the repo and started describing how can you make it from installation to deployment, today I finished the following steps and I will continue in the following days  
                                   - Installation and Setup
                                   - Collecting Images Using Your Webcam or any device 
                                   - Labelling Images for Object Detection using LabelImg
you can see my [Tensorflow Object Detection From Scratch](https://github.com/Kareem-negm/Tensorflow-Object-Detection-From-Scratch) Repo and try making your model, if you face any issue or ideas feel free to make an issue or PR, and this is everything for today see you the next day
