# 30-Day-of-Data-

## this is my learning journey to learn and understand more and more about Data
##### In this repo, I will write my daily habits of learning " problem solving, structure & algorithms, data science tools, computer vision, NLP , Machine learning & Deep learning "





**Day 1 of 30 Day of Data**
- Today I was excited to learn Object Detection using TensorFlow Object detection API, so I started studying it, This video was interesting to start with, it explains how to make [Real-Time Sign Language Detection with Tensorflow Object Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDXdlXlaCco) and Python | Deep Learning SSD ,so this is a good start for me to get an idea of TensorFlow Object detection API, after this video, I started installing TensorFlow Object detection API on my local computer, but I faced many bugs in the begging so if you try to install it take a deep breath and watch this video about how to [Install Tensorflow Object Detection From Scratch in 5 Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZh_ps8gKgs), and this is everything for today see you in the next day
